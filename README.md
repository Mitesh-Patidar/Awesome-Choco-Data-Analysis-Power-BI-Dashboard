### I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze chocolate sales data.  After cleaning the data in Excel. The dashboard helps identify:
#### Top-selling chocolates: See which chocolates are most popular within each category (e.g., dark, milk, white).
#### Geographic trends: Analyze sales performance by region to identify areas with high demand for specific chocolates.
#### Salesperson performance: Compare the sales volume and effectiveness of different salespeople.
